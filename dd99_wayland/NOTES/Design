... How to create interfaces?
How to allow custom callback types (lambdas)?

interface construction must set callback types
engine sends messages that act on interfaces (sent by user calling interface methods)
interfaces must be registered with engine for id allocation

interfaces are a way of sending messages and receiving events on object ids
interfaces must acquire object id on creation and release it on destruction (raii)
interfaces are only created through methods on other interfaces (not direct construction)







Interfaces are created by user (user manages lifetime)
*** User must ensure interface instances remain valid while the engine holds a reference to it
Constructor has as first argument a reference to the engine
Base class `interface` holds object id
Derived interface classes hold static data and constexpr data
Engine holds a vector of pointers to interface instances (created by user)

interface instance functions that create new interfaces will instead act as binders for user created interface instances

what about events that create interfaces?


... so, user creates callback interface using a lambda or something
callback interface is bound by call to `display.sync()`

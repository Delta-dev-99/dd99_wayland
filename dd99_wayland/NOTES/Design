How to allow custom callback types (lambdas)?

interface construction must set callback types
engine sends messages that act on interfaces (sent by user calling interface methods)
interfaces must be registered with engine for id allocation

interfaces are a way of sending messages and receiving events on object ids
interfaces must acquire object id on creation and release it on destruction (raii)
interfaces are only created through methods on other interfaces (not direct construction)
